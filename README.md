# An Aspiring Product Data Scientist Journey - From Understanding Borroweers' Profile to Dynamic Downward Rates Adjustment


## Introduction

The intention of this notebook is first and foremost to showcase how I would run an end-to-end data science project based on Lending Club dataset and its domain problems. Second, from here with the data insights in hand, I will take you reader on a journey on how I will create AI/Machine Learning product/services.

I will be walking you through the following core objectives (more details in the following sections):

PRODUCT-DRIVEN

1. Identify and Solve critical Lending Club's business objectives/domain problems in the areas of finance, operations, marketing through machine learning and statistical methodologies.

2. Develop agile data science approach that focuses on multiple iterations, collaboration with stakeholders, responding to change, and demonstrating working machine learning models.

DATA SCIENCE-DRIVEN

3. Discover and Build new data insight through the OSEMN data science framework.

4. Explore, Formulate, and Predict Lending Club loan default and loss in investment. The objective is to model/engineer a predictive model that could determine a good and bad loan before and during the loan approval process.

5. Use Design of Experiments (DoE) to explore new way looking at the domain problem, design the right testing/validation framework, and to monitor the efficacy of modeling/processes.
